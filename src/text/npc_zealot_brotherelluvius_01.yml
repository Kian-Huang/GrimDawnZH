            The vile Cult of Ch'thon has long been an agent of corruption and chaos within Cairn, but their activities since 顫慄黎明 are reaching catastrophic levels.{^n}{^n}Even now they summon creatures from the Void using their heathen blood rituals. These rituals must be stopped at any cost. The cultists are known to use special Seals of Binding when practicing their art. Their most powerful members often carry them on their person.If you truly are interested in Father Kymon's mission, then you must recover these Seals and bring them to me so that they can be incinerated in Empyrion's fire.
