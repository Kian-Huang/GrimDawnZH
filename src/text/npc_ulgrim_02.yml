            Well, if it isn't my savior! I cannot thank you enough. I finally get to cook for other people again. Here, have some soup! Could use some salt, but Captain Whiskey over there insists that it's for combat use only.

            要不是你我的拯救者，真不知道會怎麼樣！我怎麼感謝你都不夠。終於我又能給別人做飯了。拿著，喝點粥！本來要加點鹽的，但是這兒的維斯基隊長說鹽只能用來戰鬥。

            Come back any time. I've got a few old stories to tell if you have an ear to listen.

            你隨時都可以回來這兒。如果你想聽的話，我有幾個老掉牙的故事。

            How much do you know of the former Warden? Rumors of Krieg's strange and violent behavior even reached my ears in the distant capital. When he failed to respond to multiple summons, an agent was dispatched from the capital to... resolve the situation. Unfortunately, the Grim Dawn was unleashed before the man could reach Krieg. At least, I assume that must be what happened.

            你對前任典獄長了解多少？我在遙遠的首都都聽說克里格做出奇怪又暴力的舉動的傳言了。當他對幾次徵召置之不理之後，帝都就派了一名執法官……來解決這種窘境。不幸的是，在那個人找到克里格之前，恐怖黎明就來臨了。至少，我是這麼認為的。

            Did I tell this one already? I once had to deal with a particularly rude dignitary from the capital who had even slighted the Emperor! The man made a huge fuss about his food being bland, so I whipped him up a little chef's special filled with my strongest spices. Let's just say he ran out of there spilling from both ends. Oddly enough, I heard he died the next day. I hope it didn't have anything to do with the spices I used.
        譯文 : >-
            我不知道對別人講過這件事沒有。曾經在帝都我和一位非常無禮的權貴打過交道，他甚至看不起皇帝。那個傢伙對他平淡寡味的食物很是不滿意，所以我就給他加了大廚特質的重口味調料。這麼說吧，他跑了出去，然後身體兩端都開始噴飯了。說來也奇怪，我聽說第二天他就死了。我希望這跟我使的調料沒關係。

            I served a follower of Dreeg once. Now, I don't normally judge a man based on his beliefs, but those people believe in some twisted stuff. The all-seeing eye, the hidden realm the witch gods supposedly reside in, how Dreeg is the watcher that guards the way. No wonder they're so uptight if they think someone is staring at them all the time! It's funny though, apparently someone was watching him after all. Not long after we parted ways, an inquisitor took him in for questioning and he was never seen again. At least, that's what I heard.
        譯文 : >-
            我曾經服侍過德里格的追隨者。我一般不根據一個人的信仰來評價這個人怎麼樣，但是那些傢伙確實信仰著一些邪門兒的東西。全知之眼，巫神居住的隱祕國度，還有德里格是怎麼看守著他的國度。怪不得他們這麼緊張，原來他們認為有人無時無刻都在盯著他們看！很有趣的是，確實有人一直在盯著他。在我和他分道揚鑣不久之後，一位審判官就把他抓去問話，之後再也沒有見過他的人影。至少，我聽說這麼回事。

            Ever consider a bowl of Slith stew? Don't. They may eat us and it seems only fair we should eat them back but I tried boiling one once and it ruined a set of pots and ladles. Incidentally, I heard a strange tale once that the Slith were created by humans. The story went that the Emperor's general staff wanted an army that could fight effectively in the southern swamps. Horrific human experimentation lead to the creation of a reptilian humanoid but they were uncontrollable, escaped captivity and began to breed out in the wilds. I'm sure that's just a legend though.

            想過來一碗燉蛇人肉麼？想都別想，它們吃我們我們吃它們雖然看來很公平。但是我試過煮了一次，結果弄壞了我一套鍋和勺。意外聽說過，蛇人以前是由人類創造的。故事是說帝國的總參謀部想要一支能在南方沼澤作戰的部隊。可怕的人類實驗創造出了一種類人的爬蟲動物，可以人類無法控制它們。於是它們逃了出去，在野外繁殖起來。不過我確定這只是一個傳說罷了。

            Prior to the Grim Dawn, I served a meal to some gentlemen in the capital who were deep in conversation about a remarkable new method of travel using arcane gateways. They said it would allow the Emperor's armies, stationed in the capital, to appear almost instantly in the furthest provinces. Imagine to what lengths the emperor's general staff would go to procure such a decisive military advantage. You know, hearing myself say it, it sounds very similar to that portal you used to rescue me from the swamp.
        譯文 : >-
            在恐怖黎明發生之前，我曾侍奉過一位紳士。他談到一種使用奧術門來進行旅行的新方法。他們說這法子能讓駐紮在帝都的軍隊幾乎瞬間就到達遠方的行省。想想帝國總參謀部會有多想這種決定性的軍事技術吧。這跟你救我時使用的傳送門很相像。

            One thing still bothers me about the way events unfolded during the Grim Dawn. I was working in the capital during the weeks prior to the attack and I remember two of the three legions there were dispatched to remote provinces for seemingly no reason. It seemed very peculiar to me at the time that they would leave the capital so exposed but, then again, I'm just a simple cook. Who am I to question the workings of the military?
        譯文 : >-
            在恐怖黎明期間有一件事還困擾著我。在遭受攻擊幾周之前我在帝都工作著，我記得那裡三支軍團中的兩支被毫無理由地派去了遠方的行省。對我來說他們如此暴露無遺地離開帝都實在是很特殊，不過還是那句話，我只是個廚子。我哪有本事去管什麼軍隊的調動？

            Don't discount the effectiveness of piercing weapons. They may not have the raw damage dealing power of a heavy mace or brutal axe but their ability to penetrate armor can be very effective against more heavily armored foes. At least, that's what I've heard and, you know, my profession has made me very familiar with blades. Being a cook, I mean.

            不要小看那些破甲武器，它們可能不如重錘或者大斧的直接傷害高。但是它們的破甲能力能夠很好的對付身穿重甲的敵人。嗯，這也是我聽說的，你懂的，我的職業使我非常瞭解利刃。我是說，以廚子的方式。

            I've served more than a few men and women whose ambition and lust for power exceeded their good sense. There are limits to human achievement and when we grasp beyond our ability, it inevitably leads to calamity. Sorry, that's a bit heavy for mealtime conversation. What would I know; I am but a cook?
        譯文 : >-
            我曾侍奉過幾位野心和權欲超過了他們的良知的男女。人的能力是有限度的，如果我們做的事超出了我們的能力，那麼釀成災禍就是不可避免的。抱歉，吃飯時間聊這種話題有些沉重。我才知道些什麼，我只是個廚子。

            Have you run into the Bloodsworn yet? The fanatical cult devoted to the supposed elder god Ch'thon? The cult has existed forever; some say since before recorded history. I always thought the myth of an elder god betrayed and gruesomely dismembered was too fantastical to be anything but the stuff of theatre but since the Grim Dawn, it seems the cult has newfound power and desperate men flock to swell their ranks. When I was wandering the outskirts of Burrwitch, I came upon some cultists who pressed me to join their ranks. At first they wouldn't take no for an answer but I treated them to some hearty stew and then they troubled me no further. Never underestimate the power of good cooking.

            你遇到過血誓邪教徒了麼？那些假象之中古老的神祇冥神的狂熱信徒？邪教徒一直以來都存在，有人說甚至自打有史以來就有。我一直覺得一位古老的神被背叛然後被可怕地肢解這種神話故事只有在戲劇中才有，不過在恐怖黎明之後，他們獲得了新的力量而且絕望的人群向他們蜂擁而去，壯大了他們的隊伍。起先我找不到答案，但當我把他們看作豐盛的大餐的時候，問題就迎刃而解了。永遠別低估了好廚藝的厲害。

            When I was young, I had the misfortune to witness a banquet that was thrown for five Pathfinders of the biggest Rover bands at the time. It was supposed to be a peace offering but none of them left alive. The government thought the Rovers would disband once their leaders were dead but they just chose new ones and moved on. I regret how they were persecuted in the past but it seems generations spent roaming the wilderness and back roads of these lands while evading agents of the empire prepared them well for the Grim Dawn. They seem to be weathering it better than most and have taken in many refugees from the empire that once hunted them.

            在我年輕時，我不幸見證了為當時最大的流浪者幫派的五位探險者舉行的宴會。那本該是場平靜的宴會，但是他們一個也沒能活下來。政府認為他們的領導人死亡之後他們就會分崩離析，但他們卻選出新的領袖然後繼續前行。我對他們過去遭受過的迫害感到遺憾，但是看來他們一代又一代在野外遊蕩，躲避帝國追捕也準備好了迎接恐怖黎明的來臨。看起來他們比大多數人都更能經受住這場災難，同時他們也收留了很多過去曾經追捕過他們，來自於帝國的難民。
