            Sometimes, when I close my eyes, I still see her, you know.{^n}{^n}I can smell her auburn hair, feel her gentle hand upon my cheek.{^n}{^n}But then I open them again and all I see is this slith hole. This world is too cruel for an angel like Annabel. She would wither away in its corruption.

            I hope they suffered. Nobody deserves to be torn apart by monsters like that, and now there are a few less in the world. Thanks to you. {^n}{^n}Here, take 'yer iron.

            You killed scores of the shamblin' Dead, but I think you can do better. The Aether corruption created some truly monstrous mutations in some of the Dead. {^n}{^n}Go out there and hunt some down. Then tell me of the slaughter.

            That's what I like to hear! If it wasn' for my bum leg, I'd be out there with ya. Payin' others with good iron and hearin' the tales is just the next best thing. {^n}{^n}Speakin' of which, here's 'yer share.

            Then you and I have somethin' in common. After those things took my Annabel from me, I don' feel much of anythin' either. {^n}{^n}Here, take 'yer coin. You've earned it.

            I ain' payin' for a lecture in conscience. Those things are abominations. Abominations that killed my wife, Annabel, and turned me into a cripple! {^n}{^n}The only way I can get back at them now is by payin' someone like you. So if you want more iron, skip the morals and kill some more Dead. {^n}{^n}Here's 'yer pay.

            I hear you've been cleanin' up out there in Lower Crossing. If you're goin' to keep fighting those bastards, you'll need better equipment than that. {^n}{^n}Here's somethin' you'll likely never see again in this world, stranger. Somethin' for nothin'. Take some iron coin off my hands; I don't need it no more.

            Y'see, they killed my Annabel back when the village was first overrun. Ain' nothin' gonna bring her back; and if it tries, I'll put a bullet through its skull. {^n}{^n}I got nothin' left but revenge, so I pay good iron to those willin' to put down those abominations. {^n}{^n}You slaughter some Dead worth tellin' about, like the soldiers, and I'll give you some more from my stash.
