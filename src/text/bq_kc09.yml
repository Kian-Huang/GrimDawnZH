Such is our destiny and our charge.{^n}{^n}In the Blood Grove, through a rift torn between our world and theirs, there is a plane of existence we call the Ashen Waste. There dwells a cruel creature by the name Vom'Zul. It is a beast of fire and brimstone, a mockery of the cleansing flame of Empyrion. By Kymon's Will, it is to be destroyed.{^n}{^n}Anyone willing to take on this critical task will be rewarded with materials from our stores.
