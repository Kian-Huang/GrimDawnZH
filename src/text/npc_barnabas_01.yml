            Head northwest out of Devil's Crossing across the bridge we repaired. The journey will take you far to the northwest, and we haven' a clue what's out there. Start by following the road out into the Arkovian Foothills, all the way through Old Arkovia. With luck, the old coastal bridge near Twin Falls still stands. If that's not an option, you will have to look for Smuggler's Pass. It's an old smuggling route that ran through the Broken Hills. It should connect to Homestead.{^n}{^n}We must find out whether the farmlands can still support us, or if the Grim Dawn claimed them as it did Burrwitch.

            That ol' hole in the ground once served many a smuggler in avoiding imperial patrols along the coast road. Smuggler's Pass was never the safest route, but if you needed to avoid prying eyes, it was a blessing. Why, it served me many a time in my younger restless years. Course, that's all ancient history now.

            Right to business then. Before the world fell apart, Burrwitch got its food stocks from the vast farmlands to the northwest. With the bridge repaired, we need to find a way back to Homestead.{^n}{^n}The journey will take you far to the northwest, and I haven' a clue what's out there.
