            The Black Legion has a stronghold to the north, Fort Ikon. It lies just beyond the Asterkarn Mountains, through the Darkvale Gates.{^n}{^n}We are leaving soon with a small contingent of troops. Meet us there as soon as you are able.

            With the cultist ranks scattered, we can once again reconnect with the main Legion force to the north, and just in time too. Based on the information you've brought back from Karroz, we need to immediately send all available forces to the Necropolis and stop that ritual.{^n}{^n}Ulgrim and I will be leaving shortly with a small contingent of troops. Will you meet us at Fort Ikon? It lies just beyond the Asterkarn Mountains, through the Darkvale Gates.

            Hm, I have heard of this ritual. It has been performed only once before, if my memory serves me, and the results were...shall we say, not good.{^n}{^n}The Cult must not be allowed to see this through. We must make haste to Fort Ikon at once. Will you join us?

            There was once a time when I would have been tasked with tracking down members of the Order of Death's Vigil, but I think we are a little past the privilege of such prejudice.{^n}{^n}Kymon's Chosen are fanatical heretics, but faith can be a powerful weapon.

            I hear you are headed to the Gruesome Harvest. Be mindful of the possessed trolls. They are even stronger than their living counterparts and highly resistant to the Aether. The Vanguards can even unleash the Aether in a burst of energy around them.{^n}{^n}The Reanimators will resurrect additional allies if not dealt with quickly, but if you manage to destroy them, their minions will fall along with them.

            I've long known of Ulgrim by his previous title, the First Blade, although I was fortunate not to have met him in his working capacity back then. It was not until the days prior to the Grim Dawn that I met him in person. It was our mutual awareness of the Aetherial conspiracy and individual inability to counter it that brought us together. In the end, we realized the Aetherials already controlled too much of the government and could not be stopped. So we instead set out to gather resources and allies to weather the invasion and launch a resistance.

            Yes, the emperor's spymaster and assassin. His name was stricken from all the records. His very identity erased so he could exist outside the boundaries of the law.{^n}{^n}This gave the emperor great freedom in handling matters some would deem objectionable to the throne. All knew it, none would dare bring it to light lest they have a meeting with the First Blade. He was truly unparalleled in his art; feared even by the nightblades of the noble houses, many of whom silently met their end at his hands. One might question the morality of his job but not the ruthless effectiveness of his performance. {^n}{^n}I will say though, he did deliver a form of justice to many corrupt and vile men. He silenced many conflicts before they could grow into larger and bloodier ordeals.

            As an inquisitor, I had access to many occult artifacts and relics that had come into the safekeeping of the Luminari. Some that were deemed more benign were occasionally lent out to veteran inquisitors and I have used them to great advantage.{^n}{^n}Krieg underestimated that.

            These aren't toys we just hand out to everybody. They are powerful artifacts that have to be handled carefully. Besides that, they are now irreplaceable as the vault of the Luminari has fallen into the hands of our enemies. I can only hope that the Aetherials never discern the power of some of the more potent objects within the vaults or are at least wise enough not to use them.{^n}{^n}In any case, I'm afraid the answer is no.

            The inquisitors of the Luminari were responsible for investigating and eliminating any supernatural threats within the empire. That could mean anything from breaking up an occult coven to securing a dangerous artifact or even hunting down otherworldly creatures that occasionally cross the veil between realities.{^n}{^n}The Cult of Ch'thon was one of the greatest challenges because the root of it, the dying god, is beyond our reach or power to destroy. It has been with us since ancient times. Given their recent rise to power, it also seems to be one of our greatest failures.
