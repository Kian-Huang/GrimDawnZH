            I'm afraid there isn't much to tell. My great great great grandfather, Cullis Oldbarrow, settled on this land back when the crimson plague was going around the capital. He wasn't a farmer, in fact he was a banker, but he wanted to get his family out and away from the heavily populated areas.{^n}{^n}The Oldbarrows weren't the first to settle in this area, but we made it our home for generations among the tight-knit farming community. In times of trouble, we all gather here and take care of each other.

            The Dermapteran hives are cyclical in nature. Every seven years or so, they birth a new queen, which promptly proliferates their numbers and causes them to explode across the countryside.{^n}{^n}In the past, we would rally together and exterminate the queen while she was still young. But after the Grim Dawn, the Dermapterans were allowed to thrive, and their queen has molted into a massive creature that spawns new Dermapterans by the dozen every day.She has to be destroyed, otherwise the insects will eventually run out of food and attack us in force. The queen is always guarded by two of her Grand Viziers, so you would have to acquire their pheromone glands to even enter her chamber. We know that the Royal Hive is somewhere out in the Rotting Croplands, to the west of Homestead.{^n}{^n}After the way you handled the infested fields, I am confident in your abilities. Will you help us halt the Dermapteran reproductive cycle? I will gladly pool together all of our iron bits if you can pull this off.

            There are two farms just west of here, belonging to Elmsworth and Thornsbury, which would be the ideal next steps in expanding our food production. If you could clear out the Dermapteran egg clusters there, along with any Dermapterans protecting them, then perhaps I can convince the captain to at least assign guards to the farms and allow our men to work the fields.

            Captain Somer is only concerned with the Aetherials and the Cult of Ch'thon.

            Homestead and the surrounding farmlands have been providing food to the nearby towns and villages for centuries. My family has worked this land for over two hundred years. But when the Grim Dawn struck, that all seemed to fall apart in an instant.{^n}{^n}Now we are contending with Dermapterans, Aetherials and bloodthirsty cultists, virtually at the same time. Homestead has become a hurricane of conflict, and we are at the eye of the storm.
