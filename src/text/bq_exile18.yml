In fact, they have deep shamanistic roots that grant them a profound connection to nature.{^n}{^n}I intend to tap into this power for my next study. Acquire the means to create a Mistborn Talisman from the trolls, the biggest brute likely knows the most.{^n}{^n}Bring the instructions to a trusted blacksmith and have them create the Talisman, then bring it to me. Just goes to show you that great power can come from the most unlikely sources.{^n}{^n}Do this for me and I shall reward you with some of my valuables.
