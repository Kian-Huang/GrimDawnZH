            So, Bourbon's dog has come barking. You should give up trying to act the savior, it doesn't suit you. Humanity is already doomed and a new power is rising. Get on board like I did or go extinct.{^n}{^n}Well, that's not quite true, the Aetherials will need new vessels, so I'm sure they'll keep some domesticated humans around to breed like livestock. You know, I heard that you were 'Taken' when they found you, I bet your offspring would make good vessels.

            Isn't it obvious? Devil's Crossing may be prison but its built like a fortress and it controls the roads to Burrwitch and to the West.{^n}{^n}The Aetherials want it captured and, you know, as much as I wanted out of that place, I think I've grown nostalgic for it. This time, I get to play warden and I intend to have some fun, just like old Krieg did.{^n}{^n}Tell you what, give me Devil's Crossing and I'll put in a word for you, maybe get the Aetherials to keep you around as a breeder. Either that or I'm happy to do things the painful way. Painful for you that is...

            What kind of a milksop did Bourbon send after me?{^n}{^n}Don't you know the name Darius Cronley? Before the Aetherials showed up, I was the biggest public menace in these parts! My name inspires nightmares in children; makes men tread quickly past dark alleys.{^n}{^n}I'll take you apart slow, piece by piece, like I did to so many victims before. I must say, I'm really going to relish this!

            Mornay's little sweetling? A pity she escaped. Oh the delicious things I could have done with such tender flesh.{^n}{^n}She fled West but she won't get far. Half-troll tribes hold Smugglers Pass and with nowhere to run, my men will soon retrieve her.
