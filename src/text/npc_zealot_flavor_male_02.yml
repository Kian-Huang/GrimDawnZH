            I was out on patrol with Brother Hammond when we stumbled upon a lone necromancer.{^n}{^n}We've been warned about their powers, so we chose to avoid him, but he saw us. Before we could react, several of his skeletal minions descended upon us. Brother Hammond, may his tortured soul find rest, was torn apart by the skeletons, and that's when the necromancer performed his dark ritual.{^n}{^n}I ran for my life. Perhaps I should have stayed and avenged my fallen brother, but by Empyrion, my legs would not obey. Am I a coward?
