            Far to the north, in the frozen Asterkarn Mountains, there is a shrine dedicated to Mogdrogen, patron of beasts and guardian of the Rhowari. For generations, our people had visited Mogdrogen's sacred altar in order to pay homage to the day that He bestowed His wisdom upon Rhowan and inspired our people to leave Arkovia.{^n}{^n}But the shrine has become tainted by the vile Cult of Ch'thon. The followers of the Dead God have desecrated our sacred grounds and destroyed the Shrine of Mogdrogen.

            The Shrine lies in ruins, its Runed Stone and Spirit scattered among the Cult's camps. We cannot allow for this symbol of our people to be lost to history. Please, search the cultist grounds to the north and recover the pieces of Mogdrogen's Shrine.{^n}{^n}Bring the parts back to the Shrine and place them upon the altar along with the beating heart of an ancient beast, its noble sacrifice will serve as a catalyst to fuse the broken pieces into one. Once you are finished, be prepared to dispatch whatever vile Chthonians have infested Mogdrogen's lands. For this, the Rhowari will be eternally at your service.{^n}{^n}Warning: the quest cannot be completed in this build. The area you must access will become availabe in a future build.

            Arkovia was a proud city but its people were overly obsessed with war and titles. The nobility constantly maneuvered and plotted against one another, sometimes leading Arkovia into civil war.{^n}{^n}Some seasons, little was planted as the common men from different fiefs were called to arms by lords squabbling with one another. Eventually, society collapsed and a weakened Arkovia became easy prey to outside powers.Provinces were lost and the domain of Arkovia contracted, yet the city itself was never conquered by foreign foes. Its death was far more sinister...

Each was ever maneuvering and plotting against the others, all believing that if they could only seize power for themselves, they could usher in a new golden era for the city.Their machinations wrought only destruction and misery, hastening Arkovia to its ruin and driving them in turn to pursue desperate measures that brought them ruin on a catastrophic scale.

            The final doom of Arkovia, that which has cursed these lands ever since, was indeed delivered by necromancers. Necromancy is an ancient art but it flourished during the early days of Arkovia's history. That is until it was outlawed.{^n}{^n}Necromancers were hunted down and jailed in the Steps of Torment. There they were punished for their transgressions against nature, but the dark art could never be fully stamped out.It is said that one of the necromancers imprisoned in the tower never aged, even after decades of imprisonment, and they found that he could not be killed by any means within their power.{^n}{^n}He was known by the name Uroboruuk and his seeming immortality turned against him on the torturer's table. In the end though, he had his vengeance...

They entered this world horribly deformed and inhuman. Their feet were said to be clawed and from their backs sprouted diseased plumage, like the feathers of birds who feast upon the dead. Not many venture into the Broken Hills anymore, but those who do say these accursed children of Arkovia have endured and now prey upon travelers who pass through those lands.{^n}{^n}Thus the doom of Arkovia was complete, wiping out the past and future bloodlines of the great houses and cursing these lands to this day.
