The followers of the Dead God have desecrated our sacred grounds and destroyed the Shrine of Mogdrogen.

            Arkovia was a proud city but its people were overly obsessed with war and titles. The nobility constantly maneuvered and plotted against one another, sometimes leading Arkovia into civil war.{^n}{^n}Some seasons, little was planted as the common men from different fiefs were called to arms by lords squabbling with one another. Eventually, society collapsed and a weakened Arkovia became easy prey to outside powers.Provinces were lost and the domain of Arkovia contracted, yet the city itself was never conquered by foreign foes. Its death was far more sinister...

            安克維亞是座值得自豪的城市，但是它的人民過於耽於戰爭和虛名。貴族們定期互相傾軋，有時會導致安克維亞發生內戰。{^n}{^n}一些時節，沒人種地。因為不同封地的人會被領主征伐起來和另外一個領主爭鬥。最終，整個社會分崩離析，虛弱的安克維亞變得容易被外來勢力入侵。丟失了許多行省，安克維亞的疆域因此縮小。不過這座城市本身從沒有被外敵征服過，它的死亡是由於更加罪惡的原因……

            In the final years, decades after Rhowan, the last king of Arkovia and the father of the Rhowari, abdicated the throne, the great houses came to outright war over the vacant throne.{^n}{^n}Eventually, an Oligarchy formed comprised of the most powerful remaining houses. Each was ever maneuvering and plotting against the others, all believing that if they could only seize power for themselves, they could usher in a new golden era for the city.Their machinations wrought only destruction and misery, hastening Arkovia to its ruin and driving them in turn to pursue desperate measures that brought them ruin on a catastrophic scale. Its weight is still heavy upon this land.

            The final doom of Arkovia, that which has cursed these lands ever since, was indeed delivered by necromancers. Necromancy is an ancient art but it flourished during the early days of Arkovia's history. That is until it was outlawed.{^n}{^n}Necromancers were hunted down and jailed in the Steps of Torment. There they were punished for their transgressions against nature, but the dark art could never be fully stamped out.It is said that one of the necromancers imprisoned in the tower never aged, even after decades of imprisonment, and they found that he could not be killed by any means within their power.{^n}{^n}He was known by the name Uroboruuk and his seeming immortality turned against him on the torturer's table. In the end though, he had his vengeance...

            安克維亞的末日是由於受到了永世的詛咒，而那詛咒正是死靈法師施放的。死靈法術是一項遠古的技藝，它在安克維亞早期的歷史中十分興盛。當然那是在它被定義為非法之前的事了。{^n}{^n}死靈法師們被抓捕然後投進了苦痛階梯的監獄裡。在那裡他們因為對抗自然的變化而受到懲罰，但是這種黑暗的法術是永遠無法被完全消滅的。據說，其中一名被關押的死靈法師從來不會變老，甚至是在他們關了他數十載之後。而且他們還發現以他們的力量怎麼也無法殺死他。{^n}{^n}他的名字叫尤若布魯克，他的不朽似乎在拷問者那裡幫了他倒忙。不過在最後，他還是報了大仇……

            As Arkovia waned, the Oligarchs became increasingly desperate and driven to extreme measures.{^n}{^n}When they learned of Uroboruuk and his strange immortality, they were foolishly intrigued. The great houses lusted for the secret knowledge by which they could achieve immortality for their bloodlines and they thought to compel that knowledge from the necromancer.{^n}{^n}Uroboruuk played upon their desires and betrayed them with a false ritual that they were all too eager to believe. The souls of the Arkovians were bound eternally to their cursed city while their mortal flesh decayed.
        譯文 : >-
            隨著安克維亞不斷衰落，獨裁者們變得越來越絕望，使他們使出了非常的手段。{^n}{^n}當他們得知尤若布魯克和他奇特的不老能力之後，他們愚蠢地迷戀上了這種能力。那些家族們強烈渴望得知這種能讓他們長生不老的祕密，然後他們認為可以逼迫死靈法師說出這種祕密。{^n}{^n}尤若布魯克玩弄著他們的慾望，然後用一種錯誤的儀式背叛了他們。安克維亞人的靈魂因此永遠的被困在他們被詛咒的城市裡，同時他們的血肉仍在慢慢地腐爛著。

            Yes, the most terrible part of this tale. I had thought not to speak it but you seem determined to seek the full truth.{^n}{^n}The last part of the tale is of the children birthed after the ritual's magic had taken hold. They entered this world horribly deformed and inhuman. Their feet were said to be clawed and from their backs sprouted diseased plumage, like the feathers of birds who feast upon the dead. Not many venture into the Broken Hills anymore, but those who do say these accursed children of Arkovia have endured and now prey upon travelers who pass through those lands.{^n}{^n}Thus the doom of Arkovia was complete, wiping out the past and future bloodlines of the great houses and cursing these lands to this day.

            是的，我隱瞞了這故事最恐怖的一部分。我本不打算講出來的，但似乎你執意要了解全部的真相。{^n}{^n}故事的最後部分是儀式進行之後，出生的孩子都變成了恐怖的，非人類的外形。他們的腳據說變成了爪子，他們的背上長著病態的翅膀，就像食腐的鳥那樣。我沒有怎麼到過破碎丘陵，但是有人說那些飽受折磨的被詛咒的孩子們在那裡捕食著過往的旅行者。{^n}{^n}由此安克維亞的末日來臨，貴族們的血脈被徹底消滅了，直到今天這片土地依然還被詛咒著。
