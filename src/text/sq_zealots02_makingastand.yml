            The Cult of Ch'thon has been expanding its reach and their activities in Darkvale have been tolerated for too long. One of the cult's more prominent members, Bolvar the Bloodbinder has been spotted to the north, in Blood Grove. Father Kymon wishes him eliminated as the vermin he is. End his life for the good of us all.
