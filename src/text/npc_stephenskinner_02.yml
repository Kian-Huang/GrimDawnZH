            I would like to thank you for talking me out of committing the biggest mistake of my life. We were struggling to survive and I got desparate. My family deserves better. Thank you for showing me that hope still remains in this bleak world.{^n}{^n}I would like you to have this. It's a small token of our appreciation. I hope it serves you well.
