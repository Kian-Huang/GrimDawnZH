One day, against the commands of my superiors, I set out to discover the truth for myself. It was during those travels that I first came upon the shrine of Empyrion, the Blessed Light. I studied the ruins for many months, deciphering the forgotten language that marked its stones. In time, I had pieced together the secrets of the ancient faith and was able to recite an incantation that called out to the lost god.{^n}{^n}The spell was successful, and I had reached out to an otherworldly presence. It coiled around me and filled my consciousness with thoughts and feelings that were not my own. The truth of its words filled me with unspeakable dread.
