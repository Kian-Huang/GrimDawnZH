            I was out in Old Grove with a few others, foraging for food, when cultists showed up out of nowhere. They were using these...things...they were like giant walking mouths full of teeth as long as my forearm. They sniffed us out.{^n}{^n}The unlucky ones got torn apart on the spot. About eight of us, myself included, were captured and sent to their camp to be harvested. I still have nightmares about those jaws of death.
