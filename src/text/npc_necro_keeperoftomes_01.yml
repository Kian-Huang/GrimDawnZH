His immortality had worked against him.{^n}{^n}Ultimately, our master agreed to their demands and offered to perform the ritual which would make the oligarchs immortal. The oligarchs had assumed his will broken and greedily accepted. Indeed, Uroboruuk granted the people of Arkovia the immortality they so craved, but it came in the form of a devious curse.{^n}{^n}They still suffered from the ravages of time, but the merciful release of death would not come. They became trapped within their physical forms, even as their bodies disintegrated and turned to dust. The remnants of the once great Arkovian Empire still roam the world as mindless ghouls and tortured spirits.{^n}{^n}Centuries later, Uroboruuk would create the Order of Death's Vigil, so that our knowledge would never again be threatened by the ignorant. He taught several generations of our people before mysteriously leaving us in the middle of the night, a few years before the Grim Dawn struck.

            The Order was founded 313 years ago by our immortal master, Uroboruuk, in order to preserve knowledge and pursue the study of necromancy.

That was our master's retribution for the systematic elimination of necromancers. Following the Arkovian tragedy, Uroboruuk wandered the world in seclusion for many centuries.He resurfaced a little over three centuries ago, swearing to restore the art of necromancy and to engrain the pursuit of knowledge and life's mysteries into a new generation.{^n}{^n}Today, the Order is comprised primarily of arcanists and occultists disillusioned and persecuted by Erulan society, though we do welcome those who do not have the arcane gift. Uroboruuk's teachings encourage tolerance and understanding after all.

            Tales of Uroboruuk have existed for centuries. None know for sure in what distant time and place he was born, or if Uroboruuk is even his original name. What we do know is that Uroboruuk was central to the tales of Arkovia's downfall, many centuries ago.{^n}{^n}Under decree of the Arkovian Oligarchs, all suspected practitioners of the necromantic art were to be taken to the Steps of Torment, a vile prison where doomed men were left to rot in the darkness of the depths of the earth. Uroboruuk, who then had a powerful following in Arkovia, was betrayed and handed over to the Arkovian torturers. However, he was not like any man they had ever met. It seemed Uroboruuk could not die. His skin would not burn and his wounds would not bleed.{^n}{^n}Unsurprisingly, this drew the attention of the oligarchs, who craved such power for themselves. Under their command, Uroboruuk was subjected to the most brutal and imaginative forms of torture ever conceived. His immortality had worked against him.{^n}{^n}Ultimately, our master agreed to their demands and offered to perform the ritual which would make the oligarchs immortal. The oligarchs had assumed his will broken and greedily accepted. Indeed, Uroboruuk granted the people of Arkovia the immortality they so craved, but it came in the form of a devious curse.{^n}{^n}They still suffered from the ravages of time, but the merciful release of death would not come. They became trapped within their physical forms, even as their bodies disintegrated and turned to dust. The remnants of the once great Arkovian Empire still roam the world as mindless ghouls and tortured spirits.{^n}{^n}Centuries later, Uroboruuk would create the Order of Death's Vigil, so that our knowledge would never again be threatened by the ignorant. He taught several generations of our people before mysteriously leaving us in the middle of the night, a few years before the Grim Dawn struck.
