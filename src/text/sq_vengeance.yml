            You encountered a man, Drew Larkin, dying alongside the road in the Arkovian Foothills. He told you of a man named Isaiah, who stabbed Drew in cold blood over their wagon full of scrap and left him to rot out on the road. With his dying breaths, Drew implored you to hunt down Isaiah and kill him in revenge for what he had done. Isaiah is likely just further down the road, his journey burdened by a cart-load of scrap.
