            Hah! That's a bit blunt, but true. The First Blade, or rather, Ulgrim as he calls himself now, has a bit of a history with the Black Legion.{^n}{^n}Most famously, I suppose, was the time he executed a Black Legion captain for taking no prisoners during a civilian uprising. We had no direct orders to capture the rebels but the... more efficient route our captain chose seemed to strike a chord with Ulgrim. I find it rather ironic though given his line of work.The emperor was displeased with the First Blade's actions, but no formal punishment was ever deemed necessary, which did not sit well with my superiors.

            The Black Legion, like its history, is a dark and conflicted thing. During the Time of Troubles, when the empire was pressed by war on three fronts, refugees overwhelmed the capital and political dissent among the noble houses threatened to tear the government apart, thousands were imprisoned for political reasons, petty crime or just vagrancy. The prisons were overflowing and the military was crumbling for lack of recruits. I'm not sure anyone can remember who but someone, probably some bureaucrat, came up with the novel solution of sending the prisoners to fight on the front lines and supposedly win absolution.{^n}{^n}Most were unfit for battle and simply served as cannon fodder, shielding the regular units' advance, but some survived and did, indeed, win their freedom. Many more deserted though and eventually wound up back in prison. The empire corrected these imperfections though with the aid of the Luminari, who devised a process to essentially imprison the human will itself; mentally binding people into the service of the empire. They created a name, insignia and ritual to reinforce this desire to serve and thus was born the Black Legion.The detachment from personal life, unwavering sense of duty and unparalleled experience in the front lines of the harshest battles killed off the unfit and forged whoever remained into one of the most elite fighting regiments in the known world. The title "Death's Bannermen" was not handed out lightly. In time, because of our guaranteed loyalty and proven effectiveness in combat, we became the favored legion of the emperor himself; often at odds with the Erulan military high command and feared by the noble houses.{^n}{^n}You may be wondering now whether I've gone through the mental conditioning I spoke of and the answer is yes. I'm conscious of it all, I know I've been conditioned to be a loyal soldier but that knowledge doesn't change the feeling and I'm not sure it even matters. We are now what we are and, in all honesty, I can't say it is for the worse. {^n}{^n}I was a spoiled and deluded girl once. Heiress to one of the great houses of Erulan. I ended up in the legion due to my own and my family's betrayal of the empire and since then, my eyes have been opened to the larger world and I have found a true purpose. At one point, many years ago, my uncle abducted me from the legion, attempting to liberate me. In the end, I escaped and returned to duty. Despite the horrors I've seen, the spartan life and endless toil; the legion is like a drug that, once tasted, can't be quit.

            Well, most people can't stomach the truth.{^n}{^n}It is what it is. It's a harsh world and the empire had many enemies, both mortal and supernatural. The emperor and his predecessors did what needed to be done to survive and Erulan flourished until the Grim Dawn. Now we struggle on in a world worse for its passing and can only hope to some day recapture that glory.

            What I remember most is the screams. Innocents being slaughtered by the thousands. Rifts opening up all over the place and spilling out fiends unlike any mankind had ever seen.{^n}{^n}It wasn't a battle. It was a massacre. Most of the imperial forces still stationed within the capital did not survive the initial attack. Many more fell while trying to flee from the doomed city.{^n}{^n}The Black Legion's Commander Tarkis stayed behind to rally a defense while we made our retreat. It was a noble sacrifice and one I will never forget.

            Inquisitor Creed worked for the Luminari, investigating and dealing with supernatural threats to the empire. It was he who first discovered the Aetherial conspiracy but, alas, not in time to stop it.{^n}{^n}Creed gathered trusted allies instead and laid the foundations for whatever human resistance exists today. The Black Legion survived the Grim Dawn largely thanks to his intervention. Since then he's been helping to coordinate our resistance and providing valuable insights into the nature of our supernatural foes.

            I wouldn't say he's an expert; no one is. The Aetherials were largely unknown until the Grim Dawn. That's part of the reason they succeeded so well in infiltrating and defeating the empire.{^n}{^n}However, Creed is one of the few surviving people who had experience with them before the Grim Dawn and, apparently, he was able to find some references to them in old texts stored in the vaults of the Luminari. We still learn new things about them every day though and they continue to find ways to surprise us. We're still not entirely sure where they came from...

            I'm not exactly a historian, but I'll give it my best shot.{^n}{^n}The North Wars as they came to be called were waged over the disputed lands beyond the Asterkarn Mountains. The area was rich in resources and provided ample farmland, so it proved to be a point of contention between the two great nations. Neither side would relent ownership of the territory, and so it came to war.{^n}{^n}The conflict dragged on over twenty six years before we finally pushed them back. That was not the end of the bloodshed though. Years later, the northerners returned with another army, intent on retaking the region. The final exchange marked one of the bloodiest days in the Empire's history. It was also one of the first campaigns undertaken by the Black Legion. Back then, we were still unproven, only a few battles under our banner; but the Legion proved to be a force to be reckoned with. That same year we marched all the way to their capital, and crushed them. That was the end of the North Wars.

            When the Legion was forced to abandon the Capital, we made Fort Ikon our new base of operations. It's an old fortress to the far north once used to protect the trade routes leading through the Asterkarn Mountains.{^n}{^n}However, when we began marching south, we encountered immediate opposition from both the Cult and the Aetherials. Many of our men were killed, pincered between two opposing armies, and we were forced to retreat towards Homestead. The Aetherials now control the area known as the Conflagration, but the Cult of Ch'thon has taken residence within the Darkvale Gate, effectively cutting us off from our forces to the north. With the Cult's frontlines battered and their sacrifices freed, I believe it is now time to advance on their main position. {^n}{^n}Karroz, the Sigil of Ch'thon, the name has come up several times, including a recent bloody interrogation. We have no idea if he is the head of the entire Cult or if he is merely a pawn in someone else's game, but one thing is for certain: he is at the Darkvale Gate. I need you to infiltrate the fortress and take out their leader. Lay waste to the Cult's followers, let nothing stop you in reclaiming our bastion!

            The Legion is split on two fronts. To the north, we have the Cult of Ch'thon. Nasty bastards keen on turning all of us into a puddle of blood for their rituals. I have my best men out there right now, scouting ahead. The cultists are amassing in great numbers, and I'd like to know why.{^n}{^n}There is a more pressing issue, however, and this is where you come in. Ulgrim says that you are experienced with fighting the Aetherials. That's good. You'll need all your skills for this one. Far to the west, beyond the Infested Farms and the Rotting Croplands, there is an area teeming with Aetherials that we have started calling the Gruesome Harvest. It is a fitting title as the Aetherials have been gathering corpses, animal and human alike, in order to conduct their sick resurrection techniques upon them.{^n}{^n}The barn there has been giving off a blinding aether light nonstop for the last few days and nights. That is, until today. Whatever they are working on, it must be nearly finished. And knowing the Aetherials, it's something monstrous.{^n}{^n}We can't risk the Aetherials discovering that we know about their creation. I need someone to sneak in there and destroy this abomination before it even has a chance to wreck havoc upon my people. We'll only get one shot at this, so I want someone who has experience dealing with Aetherial horrors to handle this mission.{^n}{^n}Will you be my champion?

            I'd tell you that I've dealt with worse, but I'm not sure that's true. The situation here is about as bad as it gets.{^n}{^n}We have Aetherials and the Cult of Ch'thon on our doorstep, few supplies, no heavy weapons and barely enough men to keep it all together.

            What's there to say that isn't widespread public knowledge. We are a band of criminals, misfits and political outcasts conscripted into the service of the empire. Yet, as an army of expendables forever in the front lines of the empire's harshest wars, we've been forged by iron and blood into one of the most elite fighting groups in the known world.{^n}{^n}We suffered significant losses in the Grim Dawn but thanks to Creed's warning, we fared better than others and we're not done fighting yet.

            Why, you've heard of him?{^n}{^n}Yes, Inquisitor Creed has been working closely with the Black Legion after the Grim Dawn. His insight on the Aetherials has helped keep all of us alive so far.
