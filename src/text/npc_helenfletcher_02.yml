            I was a companion in Burrwitch, down at the Lusty Mare near the docks. Don't give me that look, it was a respected establishment. Frankly, working there saved my life. You can always count on a few eager men to defend a helpless gal. No idea if any of them survived the attack, I wasn't about to check. I put Burrwitch behind me as fast as I could. Course that was a dumb move. Not a mile out of Burrwitch, I got myself cornered by a band of grobles. It was Julius who saved me that time. To be honest, I took advantage of that man. Put myself before him that night and clung onto him since for survival. But he's been good to me, and I want to do right by him.{^n}{^n}The little roadside scheme was my idea. Swindling a few honest souls so that we could survive was nothing I was proud of, but the alternative was going to the bandits. Julius is no hardened criminal, and I don't want to imagine what they do to women. Our chance meeting with you was the best thing that's happened to us in months. Thank you again.

            我曾是一個侍女，在伯爾維治村海岸旁的健壯母馬旅店幹活。別那樣看著我，那是個值得尊敬的地方。坦白講，在那兒工作救了我的命。總是可以指望有幾個熱心的男人會幫助一個無助的姑娘。不知道他們中間有沒有人在襲擊中活下來，我也沒打算去確認。我儘可能快地離開了伯爾維治，一隊格羅布發現了我。那時候是朱麗葉斯救了我。實話說，我利用了這個男人。那一晚我只顧自己的死活然後依靠他活著。但是他一直對我很好，我也想好好地對待他。{^n}{^n}路邊的騙局是我的主意。欺騙幾個實誠的靈魂來活下去我從不感到自豪，但是除了這樣只能去跟匪徒打交道了。朱麗葉斯不是慣犯，我也無法他們想象他們會對女人做些什麼。遇見你是我們幾個月以來最好的事情了，再次感謝你。
