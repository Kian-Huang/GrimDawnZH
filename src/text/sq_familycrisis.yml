            Stephen Skinner was on the verge of a horrible murder of his wife and daughter, convinced that death was better than forcing his family to endure the horrors of the grim new world. You managed to talk some sense into him and provided him and his family sanctuary in Devil's Crossing. You should speak to him to see how they are faring.
