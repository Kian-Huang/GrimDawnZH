            The roads to the Northwest are treacherous. The Aetherial presence there is less but foul creatures proliferate in the wilds and restless spirits walk the world. No less dangerous are the desperate and depraved humans stalking the roads, preying upon the weak. It's been the same with every region I've explored, either it is held by a powerful enemy force or else fought over by numerous lesser groups, each dangerous in their own way. The realm is shattered and I don't know how we can ever hope to put it back together.

            Homestead is not going to be easy to reclaim. It's a real mess. Scattered Aetherial corruptions roam the fields but the Cult of Ch'thon has a strong presence. One of the most horrible things I've encountered, among a host of atrocities, are the Ch'thonic blood farms: row upon row of humans hanging from posts, some dead, some still living, their blood draining into catch basins like sap being collected from trees. I've heard the Ch'thonians use the blood to empower their sorcery and summon creatures up from the void. To make matters worse, gigantic terrifying insects as large as horses have infested some of the fields. I'd wager they slipped through the weakened veil between realities. Then there's the necromancers...

            The further North you travel, the more you encounter strange anomalies caused by aetherial power: distortions in reality, swirling vortexes of energy, fields of aetherfire... it defies the senses. In some places, you can be killed by the air itself. There's no way to fight against that, you just have to run and hope you can run fast enough. Even if humankind eventually drives these outsiders back to their own realms, how are we going to restore the land?

            I don't know whether this is just hopeful delusion or something more but a few of the drifters I encountered spoke of another human enclave in the mountains. They talked about a fortress built of salt rock that could repel any Aetherial attack. This fantasy doesn't consider that salt would dissolve in the rain. While that might be fanciful nonsense, there are quite a lot of old mines up in the mountains. It's possible some people found refuge in an old salt mine.

            I set out with another scout, Elsa, to reconnoiter the lands to the northwest shortly after we had secured Devil's Crossing.
